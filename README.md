# Controller-design-for-shape-memory-alloy-based-actuator
Robust control design for the control of a revolute joint using an SMA actuator.  
Model predictive control will be used for controlling the joint as it can incorporate hard and soft constraints of the angle traversed by the actuator and the temperature of the actuator to avoid any damage. This code is an implementation of following paper:
